New issues 18.11
Leaks
echo ~
exit 1



New TODO

Builtins:

unset PATH segfaults <---maybe MR issue? - fixed !

echo -nnnnnnnnnn
export declare -x
If there is one valid env to export it needs to be added to the list
exit ough 124 -> should exit but still give error message
exit 123 should exit


Parser/Lexer
echo with only one opened „ segfaultq -> say its an uneven number
echo „“ segfaults
„“ segfaults



HEREDOCS
heredocs Leak
<<eof <- no cmd doesnt run properly
cat << test leaks
signals <- lower priority


EXIT STATUS
hallo should return 127

Execution
env | grep USER Leaks
/ gives valgrind errors















 List of issues for parser/lexer

 1. redirections without command
 "<infile" ,  "<<infile" , "<infile <infile" or ">out" or "> out >> out" 
 if no cmd is specified , just redirections or heredocs, can we initiate the cmd variables, like cmd->args or cmd->args[0] to NULL?
 Otherwise i am not freeing all the memory and getting invalid reads

 2. empty space in new cmd


 3. setting everything, even the cmd stuff (like cmd->in_redirects.file_na initially to NULL if it is being used
 if this is implemented we can do a super cool logic to free everything and save a lot of lines of code

 4.exit codes

 5. signals amd signals in heredocs


 
 Builtins

1. Clear <-TERM environment variable not set.


List of issues for execution, redirections
1. Multiple heredocs, signals in heredocs <<1 cat | <<2 cat doesnt work
2. multiple output redirections - >out1 >out2  <-out1 isnt being created


 Mem leaks
 1. Heredocs
 2. <badfile cat | <badfile cat - leaking memoryy


Issues already fixed
 1. "< ls"
 fixed, everything freed


 What is working and no mem leaks

 1. Single cmd
 2. Piped cmds
 3. Infile with single and multiple cmds.  Multiple infiles
 4. single heredocs
