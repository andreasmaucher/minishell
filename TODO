 List of issues for parser/lexer

 1. redirections without command
 "<infile" ,  "<<infile" , "<infile <infile" or ">out" or "> out >> out" 
 if no cmd is specified , just redirections or heredocs, can we initiate the cmd variables, like cmd->args or cmd->args[0] to NULL?
 Otherwise i am not freeing all the memory and getting invalid reads


 2. empty line - syntax error near unexpected token

 3. setting everything, even the cmd stuff (like cmd->in_redirects.file_name) initially to NULL if it is being used
 if this is implemented we can do a super cool logic to free everything and save a lot of lines of code

 Builtins

1. Clear <-TERM environment variable not set.


List of issues for execution, redirections
1. Multiple heredocs, signals in heredocs
2. multiple output redirections


 Mem leaks
 1. Heredocs


Issues already fixed
 1. "< ls"
 fixed, everything freed


 What is working and no mem leaks

 1. Single cmd
 2. Piped cmds
 3. Infile with single and multiple cmds.  Multiple infiles
